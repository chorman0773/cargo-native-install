.HP
\fB\-\-version\fR: Prints version information, and exits
.HP
\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR: Show the results of each install operation, but do not perform any operations
.HP

.HP
\fB\-\-prefix=\fR<prefix>: Sets the prefix for installation operations
.HP
\fB\-\-bindir=\fR<dir>: Use dir as the directory to install binary programs. Either an absolute path, or a path relative to prefix. (defaults to bin)
.HP
\fB\-\-libdir=\fR<dir>: Use dir as the directory to install libraries. Either an absolute path, or a path relative to prefix (defaults to lib)
.HP
\fB\-\-sbindir=\fR<dir>: Use dir as the directory to install system administrator programs. Either an absolute path, or a path relative to prefix (defaults to sbin)
.HP
\fB\-\-libexecdir=\fR<dir>: Use dir as the directory to install programs that aren't for direct use from the shell. Either an absolute path, or a path relative to prefix (defaults to libexec)

.HP
\fB\-\-datarootdir=\fR<dir>: Use dir as the prefix for platform independent data, documentation, and manuals. Either an absolute path, or a path relative to prefix (defaults to share)
.HP
\fB\-\-datadir=\fR<dir>: Use dir as the directory to install platform independent data. Either an absolute path, or a path relative to the data root (defaults to the same directory as the data root)
.HP
\fB\-\-mandir=\fR<dir>: Use dir as the directory for installing manual pages. Either an absolute path, or a path relative to data root (defaults to man)

.HP
\fB\-\-localedir=\fR<dir>: Use dir as the directory for installing locale specific information. Either an absolute path, or a path relative to data root (defaults to locale)

.HP
\fB\-\-mode=\fR<mode>: Force installed files to use <mode> in the form of a chmod mode (X is the executable bit if the file is a binary target, or a directory). Only guaranteed to be effective on unix\-like targets

.HP
\fB\-\-shared\fR=\fI\,lib\/\fR: Treat cdylib targets as library targets by default and install to libdir. This is the default on unix\-like targets

.HP
\fB\-\-out\-dir=\fR<dir>: Consider cargo targets to be stored in <dir> instead of <manifest\-dir>/target
.HP
\fB\-\-release\fR: Consider cargo targets to have been built in release mode (default)
